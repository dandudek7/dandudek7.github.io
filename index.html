    <img src="./githubPFP.jpg" width= '400'/>
    <p style="background-color:mintcream;">Hello everyone! My name is Dan. I'm an aspiring web developer and currently a student in MIT's xPro program. Born and raised in New York, I got my associate's degree in business at a SUNY community college and transferred to Stony Brook University, whereupon my ongoing interest in web design led me to enroll in MIT's online certification program and pursue a career as a full stack developer. I am an avid problem solver with an eye for detail, and have always been a big picture thinker who likes to see how all the parts fit in to the whole. Feel free to...</p>

    <a href="https://dandudek7.github.io/pacmen-MIT-pp1/"> Pacmen Factory </a> <br>
    <p style="background-color: mintcream;">This is a simulation of a Pacmen "factory" where moving Pacmen can be generated at varying speeds. Pacmen will collide with the edges of the screen but not with other Pacmen.</p>
    <a href="https://dandudek7.github.io/eyes-MIT-pp1/"> Eyes Exercise </a> <br>        
    <p style="background-color: mintcream;">This project shows a pair of animated eyes that follow the cursor around the screen. This is a simple example of using document.onmousemove to make websites more interactive by engaging the user with effects or info as they browse the site.</p>
    <a href="https://dandudek7.github.io/bus-tracker-MIT-pp1/"> Bus Tracker </a>
    <p style="background-color: mintcream;">Using Mapbox's open source data, this map shows a marker that moves along the bus route from MIT to Harvard University, pausing at each stop. This can be used to track a bus in real time, like the popular college app Doublemap does for campus buses.</p>
